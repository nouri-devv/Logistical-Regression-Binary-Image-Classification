Logistical-Regression-Binary-Image-Classification, using jupyter notebook.

In this example, I have included Dogs/Cats and Apples/Oranges binary classification. The training data is included but limited.
The testing data is included but limitd.

"Training Images" folder inlcudes the training images.
"Testing Images" folder includes the testing images.

The first section of the using jupyter notebook, change the "class_0" to testing images for calss 0 and change "class_1" for class 1.
For "class_1_name" and "class_1_name", input the names of the objects.
For "test_cl0_img" and "test_cl0_img", input the path for sigle images testing (the training data is tested as well through test split
which accuracy is defined).
